A busy and crowded station. Full of people trying to go somewhere. Amongst the hustle and bustle, two
large cages rattle on top of two laden trolleys. They’re being pushed by two boys, JAMES POTTER and
ALBUS POTTER, their mother, GINNY, follows after. A thirty-seven-year-old man, HARRY, has his daughter,
LILY, on his shoulders.
ALBUS: Dad. He keeps saying it.
HARRY:James, give it a rest.
JAMES: I only said he might be in Slytherin. And he might so . . . (Off his dad’s glare.) Fine.
ALBUS (looking up at his mum): You’ll write to me, won’t you?
GINNY: Every day if you want us to.
ALBUS: No. Not every day. James says most people only get letters from home about once a month. I
don’t want to . . .
HARRY: We wrote to your brother three times a week last year.
ALBUS: What? James!
ALBUS looks accusingly at JAMES.
GINNY: Yes. You may not want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts. He likes a laugh,
your brother.
JAMES (with a grin): Can we go now, please?
ALBUS looks at his dad, and then his mum.
GINNY: All you have to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms nine and ten.
LILY: I’m so excited.
HARRY: Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best to do it at a run
if you’re nervous.
ALBUS: I’m ready.
HARRY and LILY put their hands on ALBUS’s trolley — GINNY joins JAMES’s trolley — together, the
family run hard into the barrier. Which is covered in thick white steam pouring from the HOGWARTS EXPRESS.
And which is also busy — but instead of people in sharp suits going about their day — it’s now wizards
and witches in robes mostly trying to work out how to say good-bye to their beloved progeny.
ALBUS: This is it.
LILY: Wow!
ALBUS: Platform nine and three-quarters.
LILY: Where are they? Are they here? Maybe they didn’t come?
HARRY points out RON, HERMIONE, and their daughter, ROSE. LILY runs hard up to them.
Uncle Ron. Uncle Ron!!!
RON turns towards them as LILY goes barreling up to him. He picks her up into his arms.
RON: If it isn’t my favorite Potter.
LILY: Have you got my trick?
RON: Are you aware of the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes–certified nose-stealing breath?
ROSE: Mum! Dad’s doing that lame thing again.
HERMIONE: You say lame, he says glorious, I say — somewhere in between.
RON: Hang on. Let me just munch this . . . air. And now it’s just a simple matter of . . . Excuse me if I
smell slightly of garlic . . .
He breathes on her face. LILY giggles.
LILY: You smell of porridge.
RON: Bing. Bang. Boing. Young lady, get ready to not being able to smell at all . . .
He lifts her nose off.
LILY: Where’s my nose?
RON: Ta-da!
His hand is empty. It’s a lame trick. Everyone enjoys its lameness.
LILY: You are silly.
ALBUS: Everyone’s staring at us again.
RON: Because of me! I’m extremely famous. My nose experiments are legendary!
HERMIONE: They’re certainly something.
HARRY: Parked all right, then?
RON: I did. Hermione didn’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I’d have
to Confund the examiner.
HERMIONE: I thought nothing of the kind, I have complete faith in you.
ROSE: And I have complete faith he did Confund the examiner.
RON: Oi!
ALBUS: Dad . . .
ALBUS pulls on HARRY’s robes. HARRY looks down.
Do you think — what if I am — what if I’m put in Slytherin . . .
HARRY: And what would be wrong with that?
ALBUS: Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It’s not a House of brave wizards.
HARRY: Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a
Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
ALBUS: But just say . . .
HARRY: If it matters to you, you, the Sorting Hat will take your feelings into account.
ALBUS: Really?
HARRY: It did for me.
This is something he’s never said before, it resonates around his head a moment.
Hogwarts will be the making of you, Albus. I promise you, there is nothing to be frightened of
there.
JAMES: Apart from the Thestrals. Watch out for the Thestrals.
ALBUS: I thought they were invisible!
HARRY: Listen to your professors, don’t listen to James, and remember to enjoy yourself. Now, if you
don’t want this train to leave without you, you should leap on . . .
LILY: I’m going to chase the train out.
GINNY: Lily, come straight back.
HERMIONE: Rose. Remember to send Neville our love.
ROSE: Mum, I can’t give a professor love!
ROSE exits for the train. And then ALBUS turns and hugs GINNY and HARRY one last time before
following after her.
ALBUS: Okay, then. Bye.
He climbs on board. HERMIONE, GINNY, RON, and HARRY stand watching the train — as whistles blow
up and down the platform.
GINNY: They’re going to be okay, right?
HERMIONE: Hogwarts is a big place.
RON: Big. Wonderful. Full of food. I’d give anything to be going back.
HARRY: Strange, Al being worried he’ll be sorted into Slytherin.
HERMIONE: That’s nothing, Rose is worried whether she’ll break the Quidditch scoring record in her
first or second year. And how early she can take her O.W.L.s.
RON: I have no idea where she gets her ambition from.
GINNY: And how would you feel, Harry, if Al — if he is?
RON: You know, Gin, we always thought there was a chance you could be sorted into Slytherin.
GINNY: What?
RON: Honestly, Fred and George ran a book.
HERMIONE: Can we go? People are looking, you know.
GINNY: People always look when you three are together. And apart. People always look at you.
The four exit. GINNY stops HARRY.
Harry . . . He’ll be all right, won’t he?
HARRY: Of course he will. ALBUS and ROSE walk along the carriage of the train.
The TROLLEY WITCH approaches, pushing her trolley.
TROLLEY WITCH: Anything from the trolley, dears? Pumpkin Pasty? Chocolate Frog? Cauldron Cake?
ROSE (spotting ALBUS’s loving look at the Chocolate Frogs): Al. We need to concentrate.
ALBUS: Concentrate on what?
ROSE: On who we choose to be friends with. My mum and dad met your dad on their first Hogwarts
Express, you know . . .
ALBUS: So we need to choose now who to be friends with for life? That’s quite scary.
ROSE: On the contrary, it’s exciting. I’m a Granger-Weasley, you’re a Potter — everyone will want to
be friends with us, we’ve got the pick of anyone we want.
ALBUS: So how do we decide — which compartment to go in . . .
ROSE: We rate them all and then we make a decision.
ALBUS opens a door — to look in on a lonely blond kid — SCORPIUS — in an otherwise empty
compartment. ALBUS smiles. SCORPIUS smiles back.
ALBUS: Hi. Is this compartment . . .
SCORPIUS: It’s free. It’s just me.
ALBUS: Great. So we might just — come in — for a bit — if that’s okay?
SCORPIUS: That’s okay. Hi.
ALBUS: Albus. Al. I’m — my name is Albus . . .
SCORPIUS: Hi Scorpius. I mean, I’m Scorpius. You’re Albus. I’m Scorpius. And you must be . . .
ROSE’s face is growing colder by the minute.
ROSE: Rose.
SCORPIUS: Hi, Rose. Would you like some of my Fizzing Whizbees?
ROSE: I’ve just had breakfast, thanks.
SCORPIUS: I’ve also got some Shock-o-Choc, Pepper Imps, and some Jelly Slugs. Mum’s idea — she
says (sings), “Sweets, they always help you make friends.” (He realizes that singing was a
mistake.) Stupid idea, probably.
ALBUS: I’ll have some . . . Mum doesn’t let me have sweets. Which one would you start with?
ROSE hits ALBUS out of sight of SCORPIUS.
SCORPIUS: Easy. I’ve always regarded the Pepper Imp as the king of the confectionery bag. They’re
peppermint sweets that make you smoke at the ears.
ALBUS: Brilliant, then that’s what I’ll — (ROSE hits him again.) Rose, will you please stop hitting me?
ROSE: I’m not hitting you.
ALBUS: You are hitting me, and it hurts.
SCORPIUS’s face falls.
SCORPIUS: She’s hitting you because of me.
ALBUS: What?
SCORPIUS: Listen, I know who you are, so it’s probably only fair you know who I am.
ALBUS: What do you mean you know who I am?
SCORPIUS: You’re Albus Potter. She’s Rose Granger-Weasley. And I am Scorpius Malfoy. My parents
are Astoria and Draco Malfoy. Our parents — they didn’t get on.
ROSE: That’s putting it mildly. Your mum and dad are Death Eaters!
SCORPIUS (affronted): Dad was — but Mum wasn’t.
ROSE looks away, and SCORPIUS knows why she does.
I know what the rumor is, and it’s a lie.
ALBUS looks from an uncomfortable ROSE to a desperate SCORPIUS.
ALBUS: What — is the rumor?
SCORPIUS: The rumor is that my parents couldn’t have children. That my father and my grandfather
were so desperate for a powerful heir, to prevent the end of the Malfoy line, that they . . . that they
used a Time-Turner to send my mother back . . .
ALBUS: To send her back where?
ROSE: The rumor is that he’s Voldemort’s son, Albus.
A horrible, uncomfortable silence.
It’s probably rubbish. I mean . . . look, you’ve got a nose.
The tension is slightly broken. SCORPIUS laughs, pathetically grateful.
SCORPIUS: And it’s just like my father’s! I got his nose, his hair, and his name. Not that that’s a great
thing either. I mean — father-son issues, I have them. But, on the whole, I’d rather be a Malfoy
than, you know, the son of the Dark Lord.
SCORPIUS and ALBUS look at each other and something passes between them.
ROSE: Yes, well, we probably should sit somewhere else. Come on, Albus.
ALBUS is thinking deeply.
ALBUS: No. (Off ROSE’s look.) I’m okay. You go on . . .
ROSE: Albus. I won’t wait.
ALBUS: And I wouldn’t expect you to. But I’m staying here.
ROSE looks at him a second and then leaves the compartment.
ROSE: Fine!
SCORPIUS and ALBUS are left — looking at each other — unsure.
SCORPIUS: Thank you.
ALBUS: No. No. I didn’t stay — for you — I stayed for your sweets.
SCORPIUS: She’s quite fierce.
ALBUS: Yes. Sorry.
SCORPIUS: No. I like it. Do you prefer Albus or Al?
SCORPIUS grins and pops two sweets into his mouth.
ALBUS (thinks): Albus.
SCORPIUS (as smoke comes out of his ears): THANK YOU FOR STAYING FOR MY SWEETS,
ALBUS!
ALBUS (laughing): Wow.
